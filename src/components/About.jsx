            I am Muhammad Ashraful Islam, a purpose-driven professional bridging the gap between organizational strategy and technical data analytics. Currently pursuing my MBA in Organization Strategy and Leadership at the University of Dhaka, I combine business acumen with advanced technical skills in SQL, Python, and Power BI.

            My experience spans from optimizing banking operations at Rupali Bank to leading cross-functional IT teams at Edulife and Kajkori, where I significantly reduced manual reporting efforts.
